        Express is a web framework for Node.js, 
        enabling development of web applications and APIs. 
        It simplifies tasks like routing, handling HTTP requests, 
        and integrating with view engines for content generation. 
        Express is highly customizable through middleware, 
        allowing for extended functionality such as cookie handling, session management, 
        and security enhancements.

        The different endpoint commands have different functionalities.
        GET makes it possible to get data from our server
        POST makes it possible for creating new data
        PUT makes it possible to edit the existing data
        DELETE makes it possible to delete data

        <h3>Code Explanation</h3>
        <h4>
            Fetch API uses promises to provide a way to fetch resources across the network. 
            With its fetch() method, you can retrieve resources by passing a URL, 
            and it handles both successful and error responses.

    <h2>Import & Export modules</h2>
    <h3>
        Modern browsers have begun to support JavaScript modules natively, 
        eliminating the need for additional libraries for module management. 
        This native support improves efficiency by optimizing module loading directly within the browser, 
        leveraging the import and export statements to manage module functionality. 
        This advancement represents a significant step forward in web development.

        The "Dynamic Websites â€“ Server-side programming" 
        modules focus on teaching how to create websites that can dynamically generate 
        content in response to HTTP requests. 
        Server-side technologies are essential for websites like Amazon and Facebook, 
        which display vast amounts of data through static templates updated dynamically. 
        These modules aim to equip learners with the skills needed for server-side development, 
        a critical area in web development for creating efficient, dynamic websites.
