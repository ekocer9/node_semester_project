    <h2>Git Commands</h2>
    <h4>
        git add: This command stages changes for commit. 
        For example, git add . stages all modified and new files in the current directory and its subdirectories, 
        preparing them to be committed to the project's history. 
    </h4>
    <h4>
        git commit -m "message": Once changes are staged with git add, 
        they can be committed to the project's history with git commit. 
        The "-m" allows you to attach a descriptive message to the commit.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        git push: This command uploads your commits to a remote repository. 
        If you're working in a team, this is how you share your changes with others. 
        After committing your changes locally with git commit, you would use git push to push those changes 
        to a repository on platforms like GitHub.

            Writing descriptive commit messages when using '-m "message"' is important
            because it serves as record for both yourself and your team. 
            A well thought message helps you remember the purpose of your changes. 
            For teams, it ensures everyone understands the work done.
