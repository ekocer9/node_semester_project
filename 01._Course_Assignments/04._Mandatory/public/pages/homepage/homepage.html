        <h4>
            JavaScript arrays are dynamic, non-primitive objects that allow mixing data types and resizing. 
            Unlike associative arrays, their elements are accessed with nonnegative integers, 
            following a zero-indexing system. 
            Operations that copy arrays produce shallow copies, 
            where the copy and the original share references to the same objects. 
            For scenarios requiring uniform data types or fixed sizes, typed arrays are recommended.

            Node.js fundamentals include working with variables, strings, and numbers, emphasizing variable declaration, 
            data manipulation, and type conversion. 
            It enables server-side JavaScript execution, merging client and server code paradigms. 
            Understanding these basics is crucial for effective Node.js programming.

        <h4>
            Strings in programming are essential for representing text data. 
            Common operations on strings include checking their length, 
            concatenating them with + and += operators, searching for substrings using indexOf(), 
            and extracting parts of strings with substring(). 
            These operations allow for effective string manipulation and analysis.

        <h4>
            In JavaScript, 
            almost all objects are instances of the Object class and inherit properties and methods from Object.prototype. 
            This inheritance occurs unless an object has a null prototype 
            or is derived from another object with a null prototype. 
            Changes to Object.prototype affect all objects through prototype chaining, 
            unless those properties or methods are overridden. 
            However, this mechanism, while powerful, 
            can be risky as it allows for widespread modifications to object behavior. 
            To mitigate such risks, Object.prototype itself has an immutable prototype; 
            its prototype is always null and cannot be changed, 
            ensuring a level of security and stability in the core JavaScript language.
